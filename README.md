# Beyond Dots on a Field: Predicting 3D Player Pose to Quantify Tactical Execution in Soccer
This repository is the official home for our submission for MIT SSAC 2026.

This work introduces a transformer for human motion prediction in the domain of professional soccer. By leveraging full 3D player pose data, we move beyond traditional 2D player tracking to develop a more granular, biomechanical understanding of on-pitch tactics, such as defensive shape, space control, and player orientation. Our goal is to provide a richer, more nuanced layer of analysis for coaches, scouts, and analysts.   

## Dataset
This research is built upon the WorldPose dataset, a novel and large-scale collection of high-accuracy 3D human poses captured during the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

## Code Release
The code used for data processing, model training, and evaluation is currently being prepared for public release. We are committed to open-source principles and will publish the complete codebase in this repository soon to ensure full reproducibility of our findings. Please check back for updates.
